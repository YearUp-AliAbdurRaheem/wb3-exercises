“Syntax Error”

I type, and the lines blur,
A language I thought I knew.
But now it’s tangled, cold and gray,
Each loop pulls me further through.

A missing brace, an endless call,
I’m lost in a sea of red.
No matter how I try to fix,
The error still lives in my head.

Variables forgotten, paths misplaced,
I chase ghosts through a broken flow,
Was I ever good enough for this?
A truth I fear I’ll never know.

The cursor blinks, it taunts, it waits,
But nothing seems to work.
In the silence of my crashing code,
I wonder if it’s all a quirk.

Compile me, break me, run me dry,
Until there’s nothing left but rust.
A simple program, lost in loops,
Doomed by logic I can’t trust.
